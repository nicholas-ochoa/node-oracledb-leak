## Usage
`npm install` and then `npm run start` to begin the test and watch the memory usage. Node.js heap size remains constant and looks normal as far as I can tell. On both Windows and Linux memory usage quickly rises to around 1.5GB to 2GB.

## Versions
 - Node v13.14.0
 - Oracle Instant Client 19.6
